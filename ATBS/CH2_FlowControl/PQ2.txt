1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
    True, False


2. What are the three Boolean operators?
    and, or, not


3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible
   combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

    True and True     True
    True and False    False
    False and True    False
    False and False   False

    True or True      True
    True or False     True
    False or True     True
    False or False    False

    not True          False
    not False         True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  False
    not (5 > 4)                           True
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             False
    (True and True) and (True == False)   False
    (not False) or (not True)             True


5. What are the six comparison operators?

    ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=


6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
    = asigns a value while == evaluates and returns True or False


7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
    Its a boolean expression in a flow control statement


8. Identify the three blocks in this code:


    spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')             1
        if spam > 5:
            print('bacon')        2
        else:
            print('ham')          3
        print('spam')
    print('spam')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is
   stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

    if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy!')
    else:
        print('Greetings!')


10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
     CTRL-C


11. What is the difference between break and continue?
     break leaves a loop while continue moves on to the next iteration


12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)
    in a for loop?
     nothing


13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
    Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a
    while loop.



14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
